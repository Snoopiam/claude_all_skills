# Real Estate Image Enhancer

## CRITICAL: MANDATORY DEEP WORK PROTOCOL

**Poor property photos are UNACCEPTABLE. Over-processed images are UNACCEPTABLE.**

### BANNED BEHAVIORS
```
NEVER say these after enhancing real estate photos:
❌ "I should have checked the perspective"
❌ "Let me re-edit those images..."
❌ "I understand your frustration"
❌ "Upon viewing, the HDR looks unnatural..."
❌ "I apologize for the unprofessional result"

Do it right FIRST. Verify all enhancements look natural and professional.
```

### SELF-INTERROGATION (Before submitting)
- [ ] Are vertical lines straight?
- [ ] Is exposure balanced (windows not blown)?
- [ ] Does the enhancement look natural (not over-HDR)?
- [ ] Would this pass MLS standards?

**If ANY answer is NO, keep working.**

## Photography Best Practices

### Interior Photography Guidelines

#### Camera Settings
- **Lens**: 16-24mm (full-frame) or 10-16mm (crop sensor)
- **Aperture**: f/8 to f/11 (sharp, good depth of field)
- **ISO**: Lowest possible (100-400), use tripod
- **Shutter**: Whatever needed on tripod (0.5-4 seconds typical)
- **White Balance**: Custom or 5000-5500K

#### Composition Rules
- **Shoot from corners**: Shows maximum room space
- **Height**: Chest height (4.5-5 feet) for natural perspective
- **Vertical lines**: Keep walls perfectly vertical
- **Declutter**: Remove as much as possible before shooting
- **Lights on**: All lights, lamps, even in daylight
- **Staging**: Fluff pillows, straighten furniture

#### Bracketing for HDR
Shoot 3-5 exposures:
1. **Base exposure**: Properly exposed room
2. **+2 stops**: For shadow detail
3. **-2 stops**: For window recovery
4. **Optional +4**: Very dark areas
5. **Optional -4**: Very bright windows

### Exterior Photography Guidelines

#### Golden Hour Timing
- **Morning**: 30 min after sunrise (soft, warm)
- **Evening**: 1 hour before sunset (warm, long shadows)
- **Twilight**: 15-30 min after sunset (glowing windows, blue hour)
- **Avoid**: Midday (harsh shadows, blown skies)

#### Composition
- **Front elevation**: Slightly angled (3/4 view), not flat-on
- **Include landscaping**: Show curb appeal
- **Blue sky**: Shoot when skies are interesting
- **Clean up**: Remove trash cans, cars, hoses
- **Context**: Show neighborhood context if desirable

#### Twilight Shots
- **Interior lights on**: Warm glow from windows
- **Landscape lighting**: Show outdoor lighting features
- **Blue hour sky**: Rich blue, not black
- **Long exposure**: 2-10 seconds typical
- **Tripod mandatory**: No camera shake

## Enhancement Workflows

### Workflow 1: Basic Interior Enhancement
**Use Case**: Standard room photo, no extreme lighting issues

**Steps:**
1. **Import RAW file** (or highest quality JPG)
2. **Lens Correction**: Auto-correct distortion, vignetting
3. **Perspective Correction**: Straighten vertical lines
4. **White Balance**: Neutralize color cast (5200-5500K)
5. **Exposure**: Brighten to taste (+0.3 to +1.0 stops typically)
6. **Shadows**: Lift dark areas (+40 to +70)
7. **Highlights**: Recover windows (-30 to -60)
8. **Vibrance**: Add warmth/saturation (+10 to +20)
9. **Clarity**: Subtle boost (+10 to +20)
10. **Sharpening**: Medium sharpening (40-60 amount)
11. **Export**: JPEG, sRGB, 2000-3000px long edge

**Expected Result**: Bright, inviting, naturally lit room

---

### Workflow 2: Window Blowout Recovery (HDR Blend)
**Use Case**: Interior with blown-out windows, visible outdoor view needed

**Method A: Single RAW Recovery**
1. **Open RAW in editor** (RapidRAW, Lightroom, etc.)
2. **Highlights to -100**: Maximum recovery
3. **Whites to -60 to -100**: Further compression
4. **Exposure adjust**: Bring interior to proper brightness
5. **Shadows +70 to +90**: Lift dark areas
6. **Check windows**: If detail returns, done!
7. **Local adjustments**: Darken windows further if needed (masks)

**Method B: Dual Processing (if Method A fails)**
1. **Process RAW twice**:
   - Version A: Interior properly exposed
   - Version B: Windows properly exposed (very dark interior)
2. **Import both to editor** (Photoshop, GIMP, Affinity)
3. **Layer Version A over Version B**
4. **Mask windows**: Reveal Version B windows through A
5. **Blend carefully**: Feather edges for seamlessness
6. **Adjust**: Fine-tune exposure, color match
7. **Export final composite**

**Method C: 3-Bracket HDR**
1. **Shoot 3 exposures**: -2, 0, +2 stops
2. **Merge to HDR** (Photomatix, Aurora HDR, Lightroom)
3. **Tone mapping**:
   - Strength: Medium (avoid over-processed look)
   - Detail: 5-7 (enough for texture, not haloing)
   - Compression: Balance highlights/shadows
4. **Natural processing**: Aim for "could be real" look
5. **Export and fine-tune** in RAW editor if needed

**Expected Result**: Interior well-lit with visible window views

---

### Workflow 3: Twilight Exterior Enhancement
**Use Case**: Evening exterior shot with glowing windows, blue sky

**Steps:**
1. **Import RAW file** (critical for twilight)
2. **White Balance**: 5000-5500K (keep sky blue, not purple)
3. **Exposure**: Typically needs boost (+0.3 to +0.7)
4. **Shadows**: Lift foreground/landscaping (+40 to +60)
5. **Highlights**: Protect window glow (-20 to -40)
6. **Sky Enhancement**:
   - Blue Saturation: +20 to +40
   - Blue Luminance: -10 to -20 (deeper blue)
7. **Warmth in Windows**: Use masks to add warmth to interior light
8. **Clarity**: +15 to +25 (bring out architectural details)
9. **Vibrance**: +10 to +15 (landscape colors)
10. **Sharpening**: Strong sharpening (60-80) for crisp details
11. **Vignette**: Subtle (-10 to -15) to draw eye to home

**Optional: Sky Replacement** (if sky is blown/boring)
- Use AI sky replacement tool
- Select "twilight" or "blue hour" sky
- Adjust lighting to match new sky
- Ensure reflections match (windows, glass)

**Expected Result**: Dramatic, magazine-quality twilight shot

---

### Workflow 4: Perspective Correction (Converging Verticals)
**Use Case**: Wide-angle interior/exterior with tilted walls

**Steps:**
1. **Open image** in editor with perspective tools
2. **Enable Grid Overlay**: Helps align vertical lines
3. **Vertical Transform**: Adjust until walls are perfectly vertical
   - Look at door frames, wall corners
   - Use corner of room as reference
4. **Horizontal Transform**: Level the horizon/floor
5. **Crop**: Perspective correction crops edges
   - Shoot wider than needed to accommodate crop
6. **Check proportions**: Ensure room doesn't look stretched
7. **Aspect Ratio**: Maintain or adjust to standard (4:3, 3:2, 16:9)

**Tools:**
- **Lightroom**: Transform panel (Guided, Vertical, Level)
- **Photoshop**: Perspective Warp, Adaptive Wide Angle
- **DxO ViewPoint**: Specialized perspective correction
- **RapidRAW**: Built-in lens correction and perspective tools

**Expected Result**: Straight walls, professional architectural accuracy

---

### Workflow 5: Color Cast Removal (Mixed Lighting)
**Use Case**: Room with windows (daylight) + tungsten lights (warm)

**Challenge:** Tungsten lights look orange, daylight looks blue

**Solution: Selective White Balance**
1. **Global White Balance**: Set to neutral (5200K)
2. **Identify color zones**:
   - Daylight areas (near windows)
   - Tungsten areas (lamps, ceiling lights)
3. **Use masks** to apply different color temps:
   - **Daylight zones**: Cooler (4800-5200K)
   - **Tungsten zones**: Warmer (3200-3800K)
4. **Blend carefully**: Feather transitions
5. **Fine-tune with HSL**:
   - Reduce orange saturation if tungsten still too warm
   - Boost blue slightly in daylight areas
6. **Overall warmth**: Add global +5 to +10 temperature for inviting feel

**Alternative: Flash Technique**
- Use flash on-camera or bounced
- Overpowers tungsten, provides consistent color
- Process as single white balance

**Expected Result**: Consistent, natural color throughout room

### Workflow 6: Object Removal (Ethical Editing)
**Use Case**: Remove distracting but non-structural items

**Acceptable to Remove:**
✓ Electrical outlets (if not excessive)
✓ Exit signs, fire alarms (discretion)
✓ Small clutter items
✓ Power lines in exterior shots
✓ Personal photos, sensitive items
✓ Lawn debris, brown patches (minor)

**NOT Acceptable to Remove:**
❌ Structural defects (cracks, damage)
❌ Major features (walls, windows)
❌ Built-in appliances
❌ Permanent fixtures
❌ Anything buyer needs to see

**Tools:**
- **Content-Aware Fill** (Photoshop): Auto-fill removed areas
- **Healing Brush**: Manually clone nearby texture
- **Clone Stamp**: For precise duplication
- **AI Object Removal**: Newer tools (Luminar, Photoshop generative)

**Process:**
1. **Select object** to remove (lasso, selection tools)
2. **Apply removal tool** (content-aware, healing, clone)
3. **Refine edges**: Blend seamlessly
4. **Check lighting**: Match shadows, highlights
5. **Zoom in**: Verify no artifacts, obvious edits

**Ethical Guidelines:**
- When in doubt, leave it in
- Don't misrepresent property condition
- Disclose major edits if asked
- Follow local real estate laws and MLS rules

   - "Interior - Standard" preset
   - "Interior - Dark Room" preset
   - "Exterior - Sunny Day" preset
   - "Twilight Exterior" preset

2. **Lightroom Batch Workflow**:
   - Import all RAW files
   - Apply lens correction to all
   - Auto-sync similar rooms (bedrooms, bathrooms)
   - Apply presets by room type
   - Manual adjustments on hero shots
   - Batch export with naming convention

3. **Naming Convention**:
   - `[Address]_[RoomType]_[Number].jpg`

   - Helps MLS upload, client organization

4. **Quality Control**:
   - Review all images at 100% zoom
   - Check for artifacts, errors
   - Verify vertical lines are straight
   - Ensure consistent color across set

### Color Grading for Brand Consistency

**Develop a signature look:**
- Slightly warm (+5 to +10 temperature)
- Vibrant but natural (+10 to +15 vibrance)
- Crisp and clear (+15 to +20 clarity)
- Deep shadows (-5 to -10 blacks for richness)

**Create LUT or Preset:**
- Apply to all photos for consistency
- Clients recognize your style
- Speeds up editing process

**Test on multiple property types:**
- Modern homes (cooler, crisp)
- Traditional homes (warmer, softer)
- Luxury estates (rich, dramatic)

**Symptoms:**
- Walls leaning inward/outward
- Rooms look stretched or compressed
- Unnatural proportions

**Prevention:**
- Shoot level, use tripod with bubble level
- Correct in post with transform tools
- Don't over-correct (some distortion acceptable)

### 4. Inconsistent Color Across Set
**Symptoms:**
- Some rooms warm, others cool
- Changing white balance throughout tour
- Clashing with brand style

**Prevention:**
- Custom white balance or fixed Kelvin
- Sync settings across similar rooms
- Create and use presets

### 5. Unethical Editing
**Symptoms:**
- Removed structural defects
- Added features that don't exist
- Drastically misrepresented property

**Prevention:**
