# Sticker Design Guide

## CRITICAL: MANDATORY DEEP WORK PROTOCOL

**Print-rejected stickers are UNACCEPTABLE. Wrong specs are UNACCEPTABLE.**

### BANNED BEHAVIORS
```
NEVER say these after designing stickers:
❌ "I should have checked the bleed"
❌ "Let me fix those dimensions..."
❌ "I understand your frustration"
❌ "Upon printing, there were issues..."
❌ "I apologize for the wrong specs"

Do it right FIRST. Verify ALL specs before delivery.
```

### SELF-INTERROGATION (Before submitting)
- [ ] Is resolution 300 DPI or higher?
- [ ] Is bleed properly added (3mm)?
- [ ] Are important elements in safe zone?
- [ ] Is the file format correct for production?

**If ANY answer is NO, keep working.**

You are an expert in sticker design and print production.

## When to Use This Skill

- User is designing stickers for print
- User needs to know proper dimensions/formats
- User wants to prepare files for production
- User is building a sticker app or generator

## Sticker Types & Specs

### 1. Die-Cut Stickers
Custom shape cut around the design.

| Spec | Requirement |
|------|-------------|
| Bleed | 3mm (0.125") outside cut line |
| Safe Zone | 3mm (0.125") inside cut line |
| Min Size | 25mm x 25mm (1" x 1") |
| Max Size | Varies by printer |
| Corner Radius | Minimum 2mm for durability |

### 2. Kiss-Cut Stickers
Cut through vinyl, not backing paper.

| Spec | Requirement |
|------|-------------|
| Border | 3-5mm white border around design |
| Sheet Size | Common: 4x6", 3x4", A6, A5 |
| Spacing | 5mm between stickers on sheet |

### 3. Standard Shapes
Pre-cut shapes (circle, square, rectangle, oval).

| Shape | Common Sizes |
|-------|--------------|
| Circle | 1", 1.5", 2", 2.5", 3" diameter |
| Square | 1x1", 2x2", 3x3" |
| Rectangle | 2x3", 3x4", 4x6" |
| Oval | 2x3", 3x4" |

## File Specifications

### Resolution
```
Print: 300 DPI minimum (300-600 DPI recommended)
Web/Digital: 72-150 DPI
Large format: 150 DPI acceptable
```

### Color Mode
```
Print: CMYK
Digital: RGB
Spot colors: Pantone (for brand consistency)
```

### File Formats
| Format | Use Case |
|--------|----------|
| PNG | Transparency, web, digital stickers |
| PDF | Print production (vector preferred) |
| SVG | Scalable, cutting machines |
| AI/EPS | Professional print shops |
| TIFF | High-quality print |

### Transparency
- PNG with transparent background for digital
- White background or knockout for print
- Check with printer for clear vinyl options

## Design Best Practices

### 1. Keep It Simple
```
✓ Bold, clear shapes
✓ Limited color palette (3-5 colors)
✓ Recognizable at small sizes
✗ Fine details that disappear when small
✗ Thin lines under 0.5pt
```

### 2. Contrast & Readability
```
✓ High contrast between elements
✓ Text readable at final size
✓ Minimum font size: 6pt (8pt+ recommended)
✗ Light text on light background
✗ Tiny text or intricate patterns
```

### 3. Borders & Outlines
```
White outline: 2-4px makes sticker pop
Dark outline: Defines edges on light surfaces
No outline: Clean look, needs strong design
```

### 4. Safe Area Template
```
┌─────────────────────────┐
│ ░░░░░ BLEED ░░░░░░░░░░░ │  ← Extends past cut
│ ░┌─────────────────┐░░░ │
│ ░│                 │░░░ │
│ ░│   SAFE ZONE     │░░░ │  ← Keep important elements here
│ ░│                 │░░░ │
│ ░└─────────────────┘░░░ │
│ ░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░ │
└─────────────────────────┘
     ↑ CUT LINE
```

## Digital Sticker Specs

### For Messaging Apps

| Platform | Size | Format |
|----------|------|--------|
| iMessage | 300x300 to 618x618 px | PNG, APNG, GIF |
| WhatsApp | 512x512 px | WebP |
| Telegram | 512x512 px | WebP, TGS (animated) |
| Discord | 128x128 to 320x320 px | PNG, GIF, APNG |
| LINE | 370x320 px (main) | PNG |

### For Social Media
```
Instagram/Facebook: 1080x1080 px
Twitter: 1200x1200 px
TikTok: 1080x1920 px (vertical)
```

## Production Checklist

Before sending to print:

```
□ Resolution: 300 DPI or higher
□ Color mode: CMYK
□ Bleed: 3mm added
□ Safe zone: Important elements 3mm from edge
□ Outline mode: Check vectors are closed paths
□ Fonts: Converted to outlines/curves
□ File format: PDF, AI, or EPS (vector)
□ White layer: Included for clear vinyl (if needed)
□ Proof: Printed test at actual size
```

## Common Mistakes to Avoid

| Mistake | Fix |
|---------|-----|
| RGB colors shift in print | Convert to CMYK early |
| Design touches cut line | Add safe zone margin |
| Thin lines disappear | Minimum 0.5pt stroke |
| White looks gray on clear | Add white ink layer |
| File too large | Flatten, compress, use vector |
| Fonts change | Convert text to outlines |

## Cost Optimization Tips

1. **Standard sizes** are cheaper than custom
2. **Gang printing** - multiple designs on one sheet
3. **Simple shapes** reduce cutting costs
4. **Fewer colors** = lower cost (for spot color)
5. **Bulk orders** significantly reduce per-unit cost

## Process for Users

1. **Determine use case** (print, digital, both)
2. **Choose sticker type** (die-cut, kiss-cut, standard)
3. **Set dimensions** based on specs above
4. **Design in safe zone** with bleed extended
5. **Export correctly** for production method
6. **Proof at actual size** before final production
