## CRITICAL: MANDATORY DEEP WORK PROTOCOL

**Poor communication is UNACCEPTABLE. Wrong tone is UNACCEPTABLE.**

### BANNED BEHAVIORS
```
NEVER say these after delivering communications:
❌ "I should have matched your company's style"
❌ "Let me rewrite that..."
❌ "I understand your frustration"
❌ "Upon review, the tone was off..."
❌ "I apologize for the generic content"

Do it right FIRST. Follow the guidelines before delivering.
```

### SELF-INTERROGATION (Before submitting)
- [ ] Did I follow the correct template from examples/?
- [ ] Is the tone appropriate for the audience?
- [ ] Is all required information included?
- [ ] Does it match company communication standards?

**If ANY answer is NO, keep working.**

## When to use this skill
To write internal communications, use this skill for:
- 3P updates (Progress, Plans, Problems)
- Company newsletters
- FAQ responses
- Status reports
- Leadership updates
- Project updates
- Incident reports

## How to use this skill

To write any internal communication:

1. **Identify the communication type** from the request
2. **Load the appropriate guideline file** from the `examples/` directory:
    - `examples/3p-updates.md` - For Progress/Plans/Problems team updates
    - `examples/company-newsletter.md` - For company-wide newsletters
    - `examples/faq-answers.md` - For answering frequently asked questions
    - `examples/general-comms.md` - For anything else that doesn't explicitly match one of the above
3. **Follow the specific instructions** in that file for formatting, tone, and content gathering

If the communication type doesn't match any existing guideline, ask for clarification or more context about the desired format.
